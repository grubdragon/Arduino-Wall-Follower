# Arduino-Wall-Follower
Follows continuous wall on right and front of robot. Highly customizable code. May be tweaked for a single direction(hard coding extra movement), different 2 directions, three directions, or arguably four

## Instructions
1)Setup bot as per XLR8 tutorial without interfacing with a Bluetooth Module, i.e. setup chassis, wheels, motors, a power source, motor driver circuit uing L239D, etc. Two wheels with a ball caster should suffice. [XLR8 Tutorial](https://stab-iitb.org/robotics-club/tutorials/XLR8/) <br><br>
2)Add two ultrasonic sensors for measuring distance, one in front, one in left. <br>
3)Testing: Change values of variables and repeatedly refine variables as per given problem. <br>
4)Reconfigure code to reflect actual Arduino pins. <br>
5)Burn given code on Arduino.
